Many believe that climate change is one of the biggest threats to the humanity, and that massive changes
must be made in how we live to revert it and/or reduce its impact. At the same time, there are also many
skeptics, who either do not believe in the threat per se, or that it is caused by human activity, or do not
see a need (or possibility) to do much about it. This issue and the debate are, of course, multi‐faceted, but
in this assignment we will look at the statistical evidence for global warming – a largely scientific, factbased
view on the situation.

A situation that fueled the debate in 2013 – an observation that the “Global Warming Stopped.” The case mentions the data obtained
at the time and provides the links to two well‐known sources of data: NASA and UK Met Office. We will
not provide the data file as the newer data are available which you can easily obtain from these sources.
We will first look at the temperature trends. For all parts below we will repeat the analyses with both NASA and
Met Office data:
1) Forecast the global average temperatures through year 2100. There are concerns about global temperatures raising by 2 degrees Celsius, and possibly even by 4 degrees by then.
2) What are the point predictions, as well as the 90% confidence intervals for the global average temperatures for January and July 2030, 2050 and 2100?
3) What are the quantities from Q2 for the Kingston, ON (postal code K7L3N6)?

6) Repeat the analyses using the model(s) developed for Q1. That is, train the model(s) on the pre‐2007 data and use it to make predictions, make the constant temperature prediction per Mr. Armstrong, and compare the two kinds of predictions using the actual temperatures for 2007‐2017 (a period of the bet).
7) Repeat the same analyses with another starting time and long‐enough time‐interval of your choice.
